        <h2>1. Initial Concept & Theme</h2>
        <p>This deck started as a Chocobo concept but evolved into a Toski-led nostalgia-driven, meme-heavy deck focusing on old-school cards and silly creatures.</p>
        <p>I pulled cards that caught my eye, divided them into creatures and non-creatures, and then organized them by mana cost.</p>

    <div class="section" id="sorting">
        <h2>2. Sorting & Refinement</h2>
        <p>As I pulled cards, I found more that were meme-worthy in SparkJoy than the seven I initially planned. That led me to consider Toski as the commander, letting me play more fun cards rather than optimizing a Voltron-style Chocobo deck.</p>
        <p>I started sorting by asking myself which cards truly sparked joy and which ones fulfilled the deck’s vision. I also noticed the distinction between cards that leverage multiple creatures versus those that boost a single creature.</p>

    <div class="section" id="adjustments">
        <h2>3. Mana Curve & Playability Adjustments</h2>
        <p>Noticing an overloaded 3-drop slot, I made cuts to smooth out the curve. I focused on adding more 1- and 2-drop creatures and ramp to accelerate Toski.</p>
        <p>Some spells, like Shamanic Revelation, became unnecessary because Toski naturally provides repeatable card draw. Similarly, I cut high-cost enchantment removal since I had lower-cost options.</p>
        <p>When recounting, I realized I forgot to count my proxied Chocobo! That was an injustice that had to be fixed.</p>

    <div class="section" id="final">
        <h2>4. Final Refinements & Playtesting</h2>
        <p>I reviewed my cuts and added creatures over spells to stay on theme. After fine-tuning the deck, I locked in the land count and prepared to test.</p>
        <h3>First Game Night</h3>
        <p>On my first night out with this deck, I got to see an old friend from five years ago. I played Joven’s Ferrets on turn three and beat face with them all game. Toski kept the cards flowing, and Nykthos gave me a boatload of mana.</p>
        <p>The game’s turning point: My opponent cast Jokulhaups, wiping the board. But I had two open mana for Heroic Intervention. I saved my board and won from there.</p>
        <p>This deck’s synergy, fun factor, and resilience all came together in its first real game. A perfect first run!</p>
