            <h2>1. Initial Concept & Theme</h2>
            <p>This is a deck about... a baby Chocobo. Or at least that's the plan.</p>
            <p>I want to make the Chocobo as scary as possible through stuff like lures to make it the center stage of the deck, even though it's a little cute baby. I want to do this through stuff like lures and giant growths and have voltroned it up with equipment like Assault Suit. The deck will have a blend of combat tricks as well, a small amount of equipment, a small amount of auras, and other funny, stupid creatures.</p>

            <h2>2. Sorting & Refinement</h2>
            <p>I find a Japanese wild-growth with bees and blue bottle-shaped, purple bottle-shaped flowers and strange insects in a deep forest, Mark Poole illustrated. I find... ...a strange creature... ...displaying a rose as he wails in Gaia's touch. And... is burning and alive... ...with death... ...and life. Mark Poole. A picture of a business of beautiful ferrets. A cute little Rootwalla lizard. As I continue to pull cards, I find more that are meme-worthy ones that spark joy than the seven that I initially planned. Now I'm considering using Toski as a commander to play more fun cards rather than Chocobo, which would require more cards to optimize Chocobo's threatening manner.</p>
            <p>I started sorting by asking myself which cards truly sparked joy and which ones fulfilled the deckâ€™s vision. I noticed a distinction between cards that leverage multiple creatures versus those that boost a single creature.</p>

            <h2>3. Mana Curve & Playability Adjustments</h2>

            <p>I start to go through each section by mana cost, and ask myself which ones do spark joy, which ones fulfill the base inner vision of my deck, and divide them in a binary fashion.</p>
            
            <br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

            <p>Here's a photo of this part: I start to go through each section by mana cost, and ask myself which ones do spark joy, which ones fulfill the base inner vision of my deck, and divide them in a binary fashion.</p>

            <br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

            <p>I do this and I start to lay out the cards in rows of ten. After sorting through the creatures and non-creature cards like this, this is the result.</p>

            <br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

            <p>I continued to pull cards that caught my eye, ...divided them between creatures and non-creatures and then organized them from mana cost. One through five, six plus. I'm noticing a very old-school magic theme of cards from 94, 95, 96, when I was 4, 5, and 6 years old.</p>

            <br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

            <p>As I'm sorting through, I notice a distinction between those cards that can add value by being affected by multiple creatures, or affecting multiple creatures, and those that can boost a singular creature or boost possible counters that the Chocobo has.</p>

            <h2>4. Final Refinements & Playtesting</h2>
            <p>As I finalized my list, I made cuts to redundant effects, removed high-cost spells with cheaper alternatives, and ensured my deck played smoothly. I almost forgot to count my proxied Chocobo!</p>
            <p>After finalizing the lands, I shuffled up for the first game.</p>
            
            <h3>First Game Night</h3>
            <p>I played my first game with this deck on a night where I saw an old friend for the first time in five years. Turn three, I played Joven's Ferrets, and it carried me through the game.</p>
            <p>Toski kept my hand full, I made a ton of mana with Nykthos, and I won after my opponent cast Jokulhaups. I used Heroic Intervention to protect my board, and from there, it was an easy win.</p>
